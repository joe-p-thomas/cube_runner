## How to Play
### Rules
  Drive through the obstacles, avoiding any collisions.
### Controls
  arrows - drive

  space - pause

## Technology
  Cube Runner is a JavaScript based game, using HTML Canvas for the rendering.

## Technical Implementation
  Instead of relying on a 3D-rendering JavaScript library, I utilized 2D HTML Canvas to give the same impression.

## Future Features
- Keep track of high scores
- Different color options
- Game mechanic in which there are special obstacles that when collided with, give bonus points
